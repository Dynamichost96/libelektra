# Notifications

## Problem

`kdbEnsure` (contracts) shifted expectations:
Applications want control over if they receive notifications.

## Constraints

- applications need to send notifications in any case, otherwise others cannot receive it

## Assumptions

- multiple transport mechanism at once do not need to be supported

## Considered Alternatives

## Decision

Have a symlink to which transport notification plugin is used.
This notification plugin is used by default to sent notifications.

If applications also want to receive notifications is up to the contract.

## Rationale

## Implications

The decision which transport mechanism, e.g. dbus or zeromq, must be chosen per computer node or container.
Within one Elektra setup, they cannot be intermixed (unlike config file formats, where many different formats can be mixed).
