libdiscount (libmarkdown2\-dev)
.IP "\(bu" 4
the following qt5 modules: \fBquickcontrols\fR \fBdeclarative\fR (\fBqtdeclarative5\-dev\fR)

.nf
sudo apt\-get install \e

.SS "Change Notification"
It is recommended to use the viewer mode if DBus notifications are expected\. Use "Settings \-> Viewermode" to activate the viewermode\.
.P
To publish changes to KDB via DBus use:
.P
\fBkdb global\-mount dbus\fR
.P
\fBqt\-gui\fR also subscribes to DBus notifications and automatically synchronizes the configuration when notified\.
.P
Known Issue: On reload the current element in the tree view gets unselected, you need to click on the element of interest again\.
.SS "Compiling"
Compile Elektra as normal as per the COMPILE document \fI/doc/COMPILE\.md\fR making sure to include the \fBqt\-gui\fR tool using the \fB\-DTOOLS\fR flag\.

.IP "\(bu" 4
make sure the qt5 libraries are included in \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
OR make sure to specify \fB\-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/Qt5\.3\.0/5\.3/gcc_64/lib/cmake\fR
